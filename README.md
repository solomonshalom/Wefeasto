A food website made exclusivly for a client. I wanted to use React and Node.JS but I couldn't as they were using cpanel without Node.JS installed, so I ended up using HTML, CSS (without a framework _cries_) and vanilla JS. I ened uo taking a lot of inspiration from codepen for the animation!

# Notes
Most static files such as the ``script.js`` and ``style.css`` files inclduing some images are servered through a CDN for better performance. Not only did this load the website faster, it also made it efficent. I am planning to launch atleast 1/3 of the HTML content into a CDN network, though it will take some time. One more thing - if you would like to contribute to the project, your more then welcome and if you do - Thank You! :D
